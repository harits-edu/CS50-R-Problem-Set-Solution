I make you break, you move I take
Love is the answer so they say
But if I went away, what would you say
Would it be enough to make you stay?
As you look to the exit
I don't even know why I'd do this anymore
I know, there's things I should know

And I know you can't accept she's the love that I kept
Scared I'll push you away, but I love you everyday
I know there's things you should know

I'm in love not because I want to
She's become something that I got to see
Won't you just stick around with me?
Oh and darling
I mistake intent for better days
While you misled me in different ways
I don't think this is how it's to end

I'm in love not because I want to
She's become something that I got to see
Won't you just stick around with me?
Oh and darling
I mistake intent for better days
While you misled me in different ways
I don't think this is how it's to end

I'm in love not because I want to (Is it the answer? Is it forever?)
He's become something that I got to see (I need to show you something about you)
Won't you just stick around with me? (Is it the answer? Is it forever?)
Oh and darling (I need to show you something about you)
I mistake intent for better days (Is it the answer? Is it forever?)
While you misled me in different ways (I need to show you something about you)
I don't think this is how it's to end
